## The workshop

It is not easy to be an academic/researcher in the 21st century. The rapidly changing scholarly communication landscape demands an ever-wider, ever-expanding variety of skills,
abilities and knowledge. While the past was all about publications, the present is about publishing all of your research outputs in an environment where governments, publishers and
funders demand transparency, reproducibility and open research. With the proliferation of online journals and websites, you will need to navigate a path to publish, license and promote your
work and yourself in a highly competitive global research network.
 
### Learning outcomes

In this half-day workshop, you will learn:
 
- How to use persistent identifiers, including ORCIDs and DOIs to improve the visibility and citability of both you and your research
- How to identify physical research objects in an online world
- How to license your work using the Creative Commons framework
- How to apply the 'think, check, submit' framework when publishing your research
- What to do (and what not to do) with your personal (and institutional) website
- How to get credit for your peer review activities
- How to pitch your research to journalists
